# Introdution

This post is aimed to remind myself of some rules in order to keep a good blog. Several years ago at the first time I tried to maintain my own blog, but it turned out that I messed the whole website up. This is because there were lots of unproper operations when I started to write, such as putting tags casually, giving up writing before I finished and so on. Therefore, there is a need to remind myself some rules when I am writing.

# Tags

Here is a tag list. In order to avoid opening tags casually, I must use tags below.

| tag name   | description                   | remark |
| ---------- | ----------------------------- | ------ |
| LeetCode   | Used to keep LeetCode records |        |
| Traveling  | Used to record my traveling   |        |
| Unix/Linux |                               |        |
| Go         |                               |        |
| Git        |                               |        |
| Thought    | Used to express my thoughts   |        |
| About      | Used by the about page        |        |
| Network    |                               |        |

# Writing Tips

A common topic of my blog is recording some complex problems I encounter when I am installing some dependencies / fixing some bugs of other codes and so on. **The point is, never record the process after solving the problem**, because I will forget all the steps of it! The right way to do it is to record all the stuffs when I am doing something. 

The secondly common topic is to record some sorts of knowledge in technical books. However, It is impossible to record all the stuffs in the books. Therefore, it will be nicer to only write the points that I was not familiar with.

# Upload pics

Upload Pics to `/asset/img/[my-blog-title]`. The name of the pic should be equal to the description of the picture. For example:
