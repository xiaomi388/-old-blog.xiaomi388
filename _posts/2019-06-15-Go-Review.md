The post represents notes I took when I was learning Go, Sorted by chapters.

## Basics

In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter.

A return statement without arguments returns the named return values. This is known as a "naked" return. Naked return statements should be used only in short functions. They can harm readability in longer functions.

Inside a function, the := short assignment statement can be used in place of a var declaration with implicit type.

Outside a function, every statement begins with a keyword (var, func, and so on) and so the := construct is not available.

### Basic types

Go assignment between items of different type requires an explicit conversion

Constants cannot be declared using the := syntax.

Numeric constants are high-precision values.

### Flow control statement

#### For

The variables declared there are visible only in the scope of the for statement.

#### If

Like `for`, the if statement can start with a short statement to execute before the condition.

#### Switch

Go's switch cases need not be constants, and the values involved need not be integers.

Switch cases evaluate cases from top to bottom, stopping when a case succeeds.

#### Defer

A defer statement defers the execution of a function until the surrounding function returns.
Switch without a condition is the same as switch true.

Go only runs the selected case, not all the cases that follow. 

Deferred function calls are pushed onto a stack.

### More types

#### Pointers

The & operator generates a pointer to its operand.

The \* operator denotes the pointer's underlying value.

This is known as "dereferencing" or "indirecting".

Unlike C, Go has no pointer arithmetic.

#### Structs

To access the field X of a struct when we have the struct pointer p we could write (\*p).X. However, that notation is cumbersome, so the language permits us instead to write just p.X, without the explicit dereference.

You can list just a subset of fields by using the Name: syntax.

```go

type Vertex struct {
    X, Y int
}

var v2 = Vertex{X: 1}  // Y:0 is implicit

```

#### Arrays and slices

An array's length is part of its type, so arrays cannot be resized.

An array has a fixed size. A slice, on the other hand, is a dynamically-sized, flexible view into the elements of an array.

Slices select a half-open range which includes the first element, but exclude the last one.

A slice does not store any data, it just describes a section of an underlying array.

Slice literals: see https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/9

The default value of a slice is zero for the low bound and the length of the slice for the high bound.

Slice length and capacity: length is the length of the slice, while capacity is the number of elements in the underlying array, counting from the first element in the slice.

The zero value of a slice is `nil`.

The usage of `make`:

```go

a := make([]int, 5)  // len(a)=5

b := make([]int, 0, 5) // len(b)=0, cap(b)=5

```

Hard to understand: https://tour.golang.org/moretypes/13

Slices can contain any type, including other slices.

(To learn more about slices, read https://blog.golang.org/go-slices-usage-and-internals)

##### Range

When ranging over a slice, two values are returned for each iteration. The first is the index, and the second is a **copy** of the element at that index.

#### Maps

The zero value of a map is nil. A nil map has no keys, **nor can keys be added**.

Some examples:

```go
var m map[string]Vertex

var m = map[string]Vertex{
    "Bell Labs": Vertex{
        40.68433, -74.39967,
    },
    "Google": Vertex{
        37.42202, -122.08408,
    },
}
```

#### Function values

**Functions are values too**. They can be passed around just like other values.

#### \* Function closures 

A closure is a function value that references variables from outside its body. The function may access and assign to the referenced variables;

##### Test if a key is present

```go
elem, ok = m[key]
elem, ok := m[key] // If elem or ok have not yet been declared you could use a short declaration form
```

If key is in m, ok is true. If not, ok is false.

If key is not in the map, then elem is the zero value for the map's element type.

## Methods and interfaces

### Methods

A method is a function with a special *receiver* argument.a method is just a function with a receiver argument.

You can only declare a method with a receiver whose type is defined in the same package as the method.

### Interfaces

Basic concept: This is a feature uncommon with other language, therefore it will be better to review this section in *A Tour of Go*.

Empty interfaces are used by code that handles values of unknown type.

### Errors

See https://tour.golang.org/methods/19.

## Note of *Slices: usage and internals*

Go's arrays are values. An array variable denotes the entire array; it is not a pointer to the first array element (as would be the case in C). This means that when you assign or pass around an array value you will make a copy of its contents.

The copy function supports copying between slices of different lengths (it will copy only up to the **smaller number** of elements).In addition, copy can handle source and destination slices that **share the same underlying array**, handling overlapping slices correctly.

Re-slicing a slice doesn't make a copy of the underlying array. The full array will be kept in memory until it is no longer referenced.

### A possible "gotcha"

This is a serious problem concerning the garbage disposal. Read the blog by myself to delve into it.
